This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Python _exercises_ currently under development or implemented & available for students.

🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track exercises support Python `3.7` - `3.11.5`.
Exceptions to this support are noted where they occur.  
🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track tooling (_test-runner, representer, analyzer, and Continuous Integration_) runs on Python `3.11.5`.

Exercises are grouped into **concept** exercises which teach the [Python syllabus][python-syllabus], and **practice** exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus tree &nbsp;🌴&nbsp;.
Concept exercises are constrained to a small set of language or syntax features.
Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and _play_. These two exercise groupings can be found in the track [config.json][config-json], and under the `python/exercises` directory.
